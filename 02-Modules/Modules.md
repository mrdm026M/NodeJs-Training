# Node JS Modules -

We split our code into different files to maintain, organize and reuse code whenever possible. A module system allows us to split and include code and import code written by other developers whenever required. In simple terms, a module is nothing but a JavaScript file. Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation, for example, HTTP, fs, path, and more.

CommonJS modules use the require() statement for module imports and module.exports for module exports while it's import and export for ES.
